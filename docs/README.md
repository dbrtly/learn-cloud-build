# Cloud Build Automation

The default path for documentation in an open-source coding project is text files alongside the code.

Close proximity between the code and documentation is generally perceived to making reading and maintaining the documentation easier for the developer team. This provides compatibility with the existing toolsets and collaboration conventions including source control, ticket management and pull requests. 

However, non-developer stakeholders and corporate conventions sometimes require documentation to be published to Confluence.
